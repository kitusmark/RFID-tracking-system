RFID tracking system
====================

With the RFID Shield and a 16x2 LCD Shield from Adafruit plus an Arduino UNO we can keep track of the employees in [RepRapBCN](http://www.reprapbcn.com). 

Every employee gets a card and all the time at work gets stored and analized by smart people who pays at the end of the month.

This system is aimed to be as independent and autonomous as possible in order to satisfy the boring work of keeping track of time.


###Things to do

- [ ] Solder all the components and test it out
- [ ] figure out if our cards work properly
- [Â ] Code for the LCD. Menu and messages
- [ ] Code the tracking system with data storage
- [ ] Ensure sleep mode during day
- [ ] Design and print a 3D case for the system
- [ ] Post some pictures on the repo


###Goodies list
- [Arduino UNO Rev3](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno)
- [Adafruit RFID Shield](http://www.adafruit.com/products/789)
- [Adafruit LCD I2C Shield](http://www.adafruit.com/products/772)
- [Sparkfun RTC Module](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12708)

Of course we need some juice to keep it running all day long, so we'll be using a wall power adaptor. We only need some milliamps. The Arduino runs almost all the time in sleep mode! :zzz:
